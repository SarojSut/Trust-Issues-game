#  Trust Issues - The Mind Game

**Trust Issues** is a fast-paced psychological reflex game that tests your attention, logic, and instincts.  
Every popup could be a trap ‚Äî **don‚Äôt trust what you see, trust what you read!**

##  Concept

The screen shows random **shapes, animals, objects**, and **texts**.

- ‚úÖ If the **object and label don‚Äôt match**, tap to score.
- ‚ùå If they **match**, don't touch ‚Äî or it‚Äôs **Game Over**!
- üíî Miss 3 mismatches = **Game Over**.

> Sounds simple? You‚Äôll be surprised how many times your brain gets tricked.
